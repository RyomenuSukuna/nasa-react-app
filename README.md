# NASA API Integration Project

This ReactJS project demonstrates API integration by fetching data from NASA's public API and displaying it on the website.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need to obtain an API key from NASA's website to use the API.

1. Visit [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/).
2. Enter your name and email address.
3. The API key will be sent to your email.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your NASA API key:

   ```
   VITE_NASA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Usage

Once the server is running, you can explore the features of the project on `http://localhost:3000/`.
